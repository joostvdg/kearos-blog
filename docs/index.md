# Welcome to Kearos
Kearos is the blog of Joost van der Griendt.

This is a demo with AWS, nothing much at the moment.

## Build with Docker & Travis CI
This is build with a docker build container; such as Jenkins and GitLab CI are now advocating.
The Travis CI will automatically upload this to the S3 bucket that will then host it as a static website!

Demo #1.
